## Technologies
* React
* A React Hooks only! No classes, no old grumpy state, only stateful functions!
* React Router
* Material-UI, because why wouldn't you
* Styled Components, because it rocks and Material-UI it's not bootstrap(?).
* Firebase, because simplicity rules
* Prettier, because it's the best thing since peanut-butter

## How to run the app

* See the `.env.sample` file and set up the keys.
* In the project directory just run `npm i && npm start`
* Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
